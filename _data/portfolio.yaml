- name: Banff
  description: Banff Distillery was built James McWilliams &Co in 1824. It was located by Inverboyndie in the Speyside region. It had an unfortunate history suffering damage from several fires and a bombing from a German Junkers Ju-88! Taken over in 1932 by Scottish Malt Distillers, which in itself became part of the Diageo Group, closed for good in 1983, it succumbed to yet another fire in 1991 and was demolished. As a “Dead” Distillery, very few examples of this rare and excellent Speyside malt can be found on the market, leading to substantial premiums for discerning collectors.

- name: GlenRothes
  description: GlenRothes Distillery was founded in 1878 by James Stuart. Currently owned by Edrington, the owners of Macallan, and licenced to Berry Brothers & Rudd, it is generally released by vintage and not by an age statement. Perhaps the fact that the distillery has been plagued by several serious fires during its history, is that their stock profile has been affected by the loss of spirit.

- name: Port Ellen
  description: Port Ellen Distillery on the island of Islay was established in 1825 and acquired exactly 100 years later by the Distillers Company who change their name to Diagio.

- name: Springbank
  description: Springbank Distillery in Campbelltown, was originally one of 26 Distilleries that operated in this region. Sadly, only Springbank and one other distillery survived the great depression, where higher transport costs eventually drove all the others out of business.

- name: Tomatin
  description: Tomatin Distillery was founded in 1897 but unfortunately floundered (went bankrupt) in 1906. It was re-established in 1909, but went bankrupt again 1986. The distillery was then bought by Takara Shuzo of Japan. It was the largest Single malt distillery in its day and relied on selling its whisky for blending as it had not established itself as a particularly well-known brand. Serious efforts have been made over the last decade to rectify this, as the whisky itself is very good indeed.
